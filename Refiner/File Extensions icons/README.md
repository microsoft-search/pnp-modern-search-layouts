# File Extensions icons


## Showing file extensions icons in the refiner and overriding the default File Extension display name

This layout allows you to show file extensions icons in the refiner and override the default File Extension display name.
In this example, we are using the out of the box pnp-iconfile to display the icons, but you can also use the pnp-icon if you prefer the Office UI fabric icons.

The idea behind overriding the default File Extension display name is to show the file extension in a more user-friendly way. For example, instead of showing "docx", we can show "Word Document". Feel free to add additional overrides for additional File Extensions.
I would have preferred to be able to differentiate between regular ASPX files and News be looking at the PromotedState Managed Property, but I couldn't find a way to get the Promoted State in the refiner data. If you know how to do it, please let me know.

The credit for the file extension display name override goes to [Line Tarber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linetarber/?locale=da_DK) who shared the idea with me.
