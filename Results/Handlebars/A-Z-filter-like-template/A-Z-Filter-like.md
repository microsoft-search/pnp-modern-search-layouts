# A-Z filter look alike Results web part #

 

The idea is to create a A to Z alfabetical filter look alike layout for the search results web part. The layout will display the first letter of the file name and limit which associated results that are shown.

see the comminity video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8eOH538j8


The end result will look like this:
![End result](/Results/Handlebars/A-Z-filter-like-template/assets/A-Z%20layout.png)


The layout is available in the assests folder.
